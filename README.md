# SpotifyJukeBox

I had to create a jukebox using the Spotify API for NYCDA:

Find the instructions below:

Your Spotify enabled jukebox should allow the user to do the following things:

Play a track off of Spotify based on its track ID
Pause the currently playing track
Display the following current track information:
Artist name with link to his/her profile page
Title with link to track's page
Description and genre
Artwork
Playlist Challenge:

If you have time and are looking for an extra challenge try the following. Create a playlist on 
d and enable the user to do the following things:

Play a track off of a chosen playlist
Pause the currently playing track
Skip to the next or previous track
Jump to the beginning when skipping forward from the last track
Jump to the end when skipping backward the first track
Display the following playlist information:
Creator with link to his/her profile page
Playlist title with link to playlist page
Artwork
